## 🛠 Requirements

Most of the scripts use only **standard Python libraries**, so **you don't need to install anything extra**. However, if you add modules in the future (like `requests`, `pygame`, etc.), you can include them in a `requirements.txt` file like this:

```bash
requests
pygame
```

And users can install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📦 .gitignore (Why You Need It)

This file tells Git which files/folders to ignore (like `.pyc` files or IDE configs). Make sure your `.gitignore` file includes:

```gitignore
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.exe
.vscode/
tempCodeRunnerFile.py
```
